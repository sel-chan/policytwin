## Current checkpoint

### Objective

Close the M0 network-enabled preflight with verified challenge facts, an exact application/API/test stack, real OPA execution evidence, supply-chain checks, and clean-copy reproducibility.

### Recovered conditions

Official challenge facts are verified and recorded. The Devpost package is cached but not exposed as a callable task capability. Exact project dependencies are locked and installed, and the official OPA 1.18.2 Windows binary is checksum-verified under the ignored `.tools` directory.

The first two approved `pnpm install` attempts resolved 473 packages and downloaded 372, then failed with `ERR_PNPM_EISDIR` while creating a Playwright symlink because the workspace is on an exFAT `F:` drive. The first recovery placed `node-linker=hoisted` in `.npmrc`, but pnpm 11 reads non-auth project settings only from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, so the retry correctly reproduced the same failure. This was classified as an environment/filesystem configuration failure and recovered with `nodeLinker: hoisted` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

The hoisted retry passed the symlink stage but failed importing `semver.js` because the shared pnpm store contained mutated or incomplete package entries; `pnpm store status` confirmed broad `ERR_PNPM_MODIFIED_DEPENDENCY` findings. A bounded `pnpm install --force` refetched the exact lock graph. The first dependency audit found one moderate PostCSS advisory through Next.js; an exact 8.5.19 override removed it and the production audit now reports zero vulnerabilities. The shared-store mutation report remains an environment caveat; frozen offline installation passes.

The first full clean-copy replay stalled while materializing a hoisted dependency tree on exFAT. Moving only the disposable clean checkout to the operating-system temporary directory preserved isolation and reduced the replay to about one minute. TypeScript 6 also required `--ignoreConfig` for the one-file fixture compilation path; all affected tests now pass.

### Planned actions

- [x] Re-read the goal and all required control documents.
- [x] Confirm the clean Git baseline and inspect the Devpost plugin cache, manifest, CLI registration, and current tool exposure.
- [x] Fetch and inspect the supplied official Build Week and Devpost pages, including exact deadline, eligibility, judging, repository, video, and submission fields.
- [x] Cross-check current official OpenAI/Codex, OPA, and Next.js implementation facts needed by M0/M2/M4/M7.
- [x] Update `SUBMISSION.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, generated rules-check artifacts, and durable decisions from verified sources.
- [x] Select and install pinned application/API/test dependencies and acquire a checksum-verified official OPA binary.
- [x] Run narrow checks followed by the complete offline regression gate and review the diff.
- [ ] Commit the checkpoint on the current branch and record its hash.

### Completion evidence

- Commands: `pnpm install --offline --frozen-lockfile`; `pnpm audit --prod --json`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm clean:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Exit codes: all implemented/narrow gates pass; authoritative `pnpm verify` exits 1 only for `license:check`, `container:check`, `submission:check`, and `test:e2e`
- Artifacts: `config/build-week-rules.v1.json`; `artifacts/evidence/opa-results.json`; `artifacts/evidence/verification-summary.json`; `artifacts/security/security-report.json`; `artifacts/security/clean-checkout-report.json`; `artifacts/submission/rules-check.md`

Append newest entries at the top. Keep entries compact and evidence-oriented.

### 2026-07-14 12:38 +09:00 — M3 persisted workspace service verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline server-service subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added a repository port and framework-independent service for complete current-workspace reads, immutable policy-text `DRAFT` versions, and atomic ambiguity resolution
- Verified: unit 49/49 and integration 15/15; new text preserves authoritative golden cases and prior source; repeated choices are idempotent; stale expected versions and contradictory default-review choices do not create versions; three service-driven decisions survive SQLite close/reopen
- Commands: `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/workspace/service.ts`, `tests/unit/policy-workspace-service.test.mjs`, updated `tests/integration/policy-persistence.integration.test.mjs`
- Commit: `85259ea1e70449c1307b382e3f2541fb7e8c2327`
- Risks: no HTTP route or Decision Queue UI exists; those require the approved pinned Next.js application stack
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit, then re-audit remaining offline P0 work

### 2026-07-14 12:14 +09:00 — M3 offline SQLite persistence foundation verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline persistence subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict golden-case parsing and a transactional SQLite repository for projects, immutable versions, validated IR, lifecycle state, and ambiguity decision records
- Verified: unit 46/46 and integration 15/15; four versions, three reproducible decisions, policy text, golden cases, and `COMPILED` state survive a close/reopen; stale parents, silent resolutions, unrelated decision edits, invalid clause/source links, and corrupted JSON fail closed
- Recovered failures: first Windows test cleanup attempted to delete an open SQLite file and was fixed by closing before recursive cleanup; a later full run found `submission:draft` removed its tracked checker report before security scanning, so draft generation now writes an accurate `NOT_RUN` report and the scanner reports missing tracked files instead of crashing
- Truth boundary: local Node 22 `node:sqlite` is experimental; production runtime/volume behavior and web/API integration remain unverified
- Commands: local `node:sqlite` probe; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/persistence/sqlite.ts`, `src/domain/case-validation.ts`, persistence unit/integration tests
- Commit: `9e293e00e06e71adcf2789e89b330af848150825`
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit this checkpoint, then continue approved external integration work

### 2026-07-14 11:48 +09:00 — M10 offline submission foundation verified

- Milestone: M10 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added evidence-derived English submission/demo drafts, machine-readable readiness state, strict fail-closed submission validation, unit/eval coverage, and a Git-history scanner self-pattern exclusion
- Verified: 21 submission and 4 demo files generated with mandatory non-final markers; checker reports exactly 37 independent unmet requirements; unit 43/43, integration 14/14, eval 21/21, security 188/188 files and 186 text files with zero findings, clean-copy replay 188 files, build, and three-drift demo all pass
- Commands: `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `artifacts/submission/`, `artifacts/demo/`, `artifacts/security/security-report.json`, `artifacts/security/clean-checkout-report.json`
- Commit: `130c3553abdd1ad668d8c367c0f819d242962029`
- Risks: M10 remains incomplete until current official rules, live proof, owner-selected license, UI screenshots, video, HTTPS URLs, form data, and confirmation exist
- Next: commit this offline checkpoint, then obtain one scoped network approval for current official documentation and pinned dependency/OPA work

### 2026-07-14 11:33 +09:00 — M9 offline security and reproducibility foundation committed

- Milestone: M9 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added architecture/threat/limitations/runbook/license-review docs, NOTICE, current+history secret/path/unsafe-process scan, fail-closed license/container checks, container prerequisites, and isolated clean-copy reproduction
- Verified: security scan PASS across 158 files, 156 text files, and full Git history with zero findings; clean copy PASS across frozen offline install, lint, typecheck, 41 unit, 14 integration, 19 eval, build, reset, drift replay, and evidence regeneration; no credential variables forwarded
- Expected failures: project LICENSE requires owner acceptance; container lacks verified OPA, Dockerfile, health route, and running daemon; browser and submission remain absent
- Recovered failures: history patch scanning falsely joined empty `.env.example` values and was replaced by commit-tree scanning; clean-copy eval self-reference was made explicit as `IN_PROGRESS` until the outer run writes PASS
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails exactly `license:check`, `container:check`, `test:e2e`, and `submission:check`
- Commit: `9602a6c38c5707de8e4aafc32a9e0ea636fa2416`

### 2026-07-14 11:06 +09:00 — M8 offline impact and evidence foundation committed

- Milestone: M8 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: made numeric case boundaries derive from PolicyIR; corrected stale golden/drift clause links; added immutable 14→30 version impact, traceability diagnostics, deterministic evidence generation, SHA-256 manifest validation, strict verification summary, and tamper/false-PASS tests
- Verified: unit 41/41; integration 14/14; eval 16/16; 8 case expectations change under 14→30; G02 blocks automatic verification; 4/4 clauses, 4/4 rules, 41/41 cases, and 6 code locations linked; 25 evidence files regenerate to hash `05e6f75a03fafa655f97c491983d3044e214f8a30c56fa31099762c095eee655`
- Recovered failure: first parallel integration run deleted the shared fixture build during evidence generation; classified as code concurrency; isolated evidence compilation under `.tmp/evidence-fixture-build`; retry passed 14/14
- Truth boundary: verification summary remains `FAIL`; OPA, live GPT-5.6, live Codex, post-repair drift, security, browser, container, and deployment are `NOT_RUN`
- Commit: `efff64154be5645fed1a15bf564bdb849a608cf6`

### 2026-07-14 10:42 +09:00 — M7 offline repair-worker foundation committed

- Milestone: M7 (offline contracts only; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict worker inputs/results, mode-tagged injected backend, fresh trusted-copy lifecycle, canonical hash guard, closed command IDs, sanitized child environment, time/output limits, bounded retry, independent review rules, three prompts, schema, and snapshot
- Verified: unit 37/37; integration 12/12; eval 14/14; real fresh-copy fixture test command passes; canonical baseline remains unchanged; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Safety evidence: traversal/absolute paths and unknown commands are rejected; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY` are absent from child environments; output secrets and personal home paths are redacted; high/critical review blocks proof
- Truth boundary: snapshot execution mode is `OFFLINE_TEST_DOUBLE` with `liveCodexClaim: false`; no SDK call, Codex patch, or live review is claimed
- Commit: `0c6fb85f392243a578eea0452b8de4ff50e58910`

### 2026-07-14 10:06 +09:00 — M6 offline differential runner committed

- Milestone: M6 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: preserved D01–D03 in the 41-case corpus; added typed differential records, per-case error isolation, deterministic defect clustering, strict schema, report CLI, integration/eval coverage, and before/after snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; integration 9/9; eval 11/11; baseline 25 matches, 16 drifts, 0 errors; fixed reference 41 matches, 0 drifts, 0 errors; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Diagnostic correction: the first run exposed five previously unclassified promotional approvals outside basic eligibility; these are now truthfully reported as `PROMOTION_ELIGIBILITY_BYPASS`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EXPECTATION_NOT_OPA`; no Codex repair claim or web drift UX exists
- Commit: `866bb205455945e0ee14afc8f776c1f5efe5b782`

### 2026-07-14 09:49 +09:00 — M5 offline case/conflict/mutation engines committed

- Milestone: M5 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added 38-case deterministic corpus, conflict/minimal-contrast analysis, 10 mutation operators, actual reference execution, strict schemas, and reviewable score snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; eval 9/9; 3 conflicts; 35 one-field contrasts; all rules reached; 44/47 mutants killed (93.62%); all 3 survivors listed; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, M5 report, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `66431fc9b8dabb93438fd8ab8d51336c0169eb87`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EVALUATOR_NOT_OPA`; Case Lab and OPA evidence are not implemented
- Next: include D01–D03 in the canonical corpus and build before/after fixture differential reports

### 2026-07-14 09:36 +09:00 — M4 deterministic Rego compiler committed

- Milestone: M4 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added pure Rego v1 generation, strict Rego input guard, exhaustive predicate helpers, priority exclusions, default fallback, compiler line mappings, snapshots, and compile CLI
- Verified: unit 25/25; 3,008-byte source and manifest are byte-stable; every predicate type covered; unresolved/invalid IR rejected; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, build, compile/manifest output, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `27a2b924d44bd900c28cb393e58e5413bb857445`
- Expected gap: no OPA binary is installed, so Rego compile and evaluation remain unverified
- Next: deterministic case/conflict/mutation engines using the clearly labeled reference evaluator

### 2026-07-14 09:26 +09:00 — M3 offline versioned ambiguity resolution committed

- Milestone: M3 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added immutable closed-patch application, versioned decision records, idempotent/revisit semantics, golden contradiction blocking, compile guard, and lifecycle transition table
- Verified: unit 20/20; all six patch operations covered; seeded decisions advance v1 to v4 without mutating the original; default-review conflicts with G02; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `506a8187bf5fd419122d8d5fdde54c7d77ab728f`
- Expected gap: SQLite persistence, server restart evidence, and Decision Queue UI remain for the pinned app stack
- Next: implement the pure deterministic Rego compiler and snapshots offline

### 2026-07-14 09:17 +09:00 — M2 offline PolicyIR and interpretation contracts committed

- Milestone: M2 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added exhaustive IR/patch types, strict semantic validation, fixed refund input schema, deterministic clause segmentation, diagnostic evaluator, strict JSON Schemas, interpreter prompt, recorded fixture, and eight-case eval corpus
- Verified: unit 11/11; eval 7/7; integration 5/5; all nine golden/drift examples agree with the diagnostic reference; unknown fields, executable predicates, dangling clauses, duplicate priorities, patch mismatch, and unsupported input fields are rejected
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, integration, demo replay, build, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e535209fb2f3f4bac00c0fe95bcfdd27c1296549`
- Expected gap: no claim of live GPT-5.6 work; recorded metadata is explicit; Zod/OpenAI dependencies and official API verification remain approval-gated
- Next: implement M3 patch/version/state logic offline

### 2026-07-14 08:59 +09:00 — M1 domain and deterministic seeded fixture passed

- Milestone: M1
- Change: added strict refund input validation, six golden cases, three drift witnesses, canonical buggy and evaluation-only fixed TypeScript fixtures, safe reset/copy hashing, fixture-local tests, and demo replay
- Verified: root unit 4/4; integration 5/5; fixture-local 4/4 in canonical and reset copies; typecheck, lint, eval, and build pass; `demo:run` reports exactly D01/D02/D03 drift; canonical baseline remains unchanged
- Commands: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; fixture-local `npm test`; `pnpm demo:reset`; `pnpm demo:run`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; `pnpm verify`; manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e509486d525c1f3a5825d39469298b70acb5025f`
- Expected failure: offline full verification still fails only browser and submission gates
- Risk: future Codex repair context must include only a fresh baseline copy and never the `expected-fixed` directory
- Next: M2 offline PolicyIR/schema/segmentation/prompt contracts; live interpretation remains network-approval gated

### 2026-07-14 08:45 +09:00 — Fail-closed M0 scaffold committed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: added a dependency-free pnpm workspace, strict TypeScript build, required root script surface, unit/integration/eval tests, README, and safe environment template
- Verified: offline install, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, M0 eval, build, manifest hashes, staged diff, and secret-pattern scan
- Commands: `pnpm install --offline`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; fail-closed gate commands; `git diff --cached --check`
- Commit: `c175d1c9e667dc98f258e36de11522479bc49ec0`
- Expected failures: `pnpm verify` fails only browser/submission gates; `pnpm verify:live` fails credentials/live integration; dev/demo commands fail because their later milestones are absent
- Risks: TypeScript is currently global rather than project-pinned; OPA and browser dependencies are absent; Docker daemon is stopped; official challenge and OpenAI/Codex facts remain unverified without approved network scope
- Next: continue independent M1 domain/fixture work, then use one approved network scope for official documentation and pinned dependency installation

### 2026-07-14 08:23 +09:00 — Preflight document-contract cleanup completed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: resolved all five document-contract defects; added Git safety/line-ending files; initialized `main`
- Verified: required control files read; stale contradiction phrases absent; `PolicyPatch` closed union present; offline/live gates separated; mutation threshold strict; current-branch/network boundary aligned; manifest/fences/M0–M10/goal length pass; staged diff clean; no credential-shaped values found
- Commands: environment/version commands; targeted `rg`; PowerShell manifest validator; `git diff --cached --check`; credential-shaped value scan
- Artifacts: updated control documents, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `PACK_MANIFEST.md`
- Commit: `38f8060cdb87c410f12e91d26b2d689ab1e07582`
- Risks: OPA is not installed; no `package.json` exists, so product lint/test/build/verify commands are not yet runnable; official online facts remain unverified because this checkpoint performs no network access
- Next: begin the remaining M0 product scaffold; request scoped network approval only when an install or official-document check is ready to run

## Active blockers

A blocker is valid only when the task cannot continue safely without external input. Continue all independent work first.

| ID | Type | Exact blocker | Work already completed | One owner action | Resume condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | No active blocker for the approved documentation/package/OPA scope | B-001 was cleared by the owner's 2026-07-14 approval | — | Continue the current checkpoint |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner/status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deadline compression | Medium | High | Preserve P0 vertical slice; cut only P1 | Codex / open |
| Live model/API outage | Medium | Medium | Keep recorded verified evidence clearly labeled | Codex / open |
| Hosted worker restrictions | Medium | High | Use container/VM host or split worker | Codex / open |
| Codex SDK interface changes | Medium | High | Check current official docs and adapt | Codex / open |
| Empty local package cache | High | Medium | Keep M0 dependency-free; request one scoped approval before installing pinned project dependencies | Codex / open |
| Docker daemon unavailable | High | Medium | Continue non-container gates; start Docker Desktop before the container gate | Owner/Codex / open |
| Offline validator/Zod duplication | Medium | Medium | Cross-check both contracts and generate JSON Schema from the pinned runtime schema after network approval | Codex / open |
| Demo recording/account blocker | Medium | Medium | Prepare script, captions, screenshots, and exact owner action | Codex / open |

## Decisions pending

Link to IDs in `DECISIONS.md`.

- Project license selection requires owner acceptance; see D-013 and `docs/license-review.md`.

## Next action

`Verify the supplied official challenge pages, record exact rules and dates, then install the pinned application/API/test stack and checksum-verified OPA before resuming the web and live-integration gates.`

## Pause handoff

Fill before `/goal pause` or any handoff.

- Why paused: `not paused; B-001 approval received and work resumed`
- Exact current state: `official-rule verification and approved dependency/OPA preflight are in progress`
- Last successful command: `codex plugin list` and local Devpost manifest inspection
- Current failing command: `none for this checkpoint yet`
- Uncommitted files: `PROGRESS.md while this checkpoint is active`
- Safe resume command/action: `continue official-page verification from the supplied URLs`
- One owner action, if any: `none`

## Final completion record

Do not fill until the end.
