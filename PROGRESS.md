## Milestone board

Use one of: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED_P1`.

| Milestone | Status | Gate evidence | Commit | Remaining risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 Preflight and baseline | IN_PROGRESS | document-contract validation, Git baseline, offline install, strict TypeScript scaffold, unit/integration/eval, and build pass; official rules and pinned project dependencies remain | `c175d1c` | OPA, Docker daemon, browser stack, SDK/API facts, and challenge facts are not yet verified |
| M1 Domain core and seeded fixture | PASS | strict validation; 4 unit tests; 5 integration tests; fixture-local 4-test suite; deterministic reset and exactly 3 seeded drifts | `e509486` | Evaluation-only fixed fixture must remain outside future Codex repair context |
| M2 PolicyIR and interpretation | IN_PROGRESS | offline contracts committed; 11 unit and 7 eval tests pass for strict IR validation, stable clauses, prompt safety, recorded semantics, and 9-case reference agreement | `e535209` | Project-pinned Zod/OpenAI integration and fresh GPT-5.6 evidence require approved network scope |
| M3 Decision Queue and versioning | IN_PROGRESS | offline patch/version/state contracts committed; 20 unit tests pass for all operations and guards | `506a818` | SQLite persistence and Decision Queue UI require the pinned application stack |
| M4 Compiler and OPA | IN_PROGRESS | offline compiler committed; 25 unit tests and byte-stable 3,008-byte Rego/manifest snapshots cover all predicate types and exact mappings | `27a2b92` | OPA binary/version and real compile/evaluation evidence require approved installation scope |
| M5 Case generation/conflict/mutation | IN_PROGRESS | offline engines committed; canonical corpus now has 41 unique cases including D01–D03, 3 conflicts, 36 contrasts, and 44/47 killed mutants (93.62%) with all survivors reported | `66431fc` | OPA-backed agreement, Case Lab UI, and final evidence remain unavailable until earlier external/app gates |
| M6 Differential runner and drift UX | IN_PROGRESS | offline runner verified: 41 cases, 16 classified baseline drifts, 0 execution errors, D01–D03 preserved, and 0 fixed-reference drift | `866bb20` | OPA results and web drift UX remain unavailable |
| M7 Codex repair and review | IN_PROGRESS | offline foundation verified: fresh trusted copies, strict input/results, closed commands, credential-stripped environment, 2-attempt bound, independent review blocking; explicitly no live Codex claim | `0c6fb85` | Current Codex SDK integration, real patch/diff, zero post-repair drift, and live review evidence require approved documentation/install/network scope |
| M8 Proof, impact, and polish | IN_PROGRESS | offline foundation verified: 14→30 impact, G02 contradiction block, 4/4 clause and rule traceability, 41/41 valid case links, deterministic 25-file FAIL evidence package | pending current commit | Proof UI, archive/download, screenshots, accessibility, and browser gates require the application stack |
| M9 Security, reproducibility, deployment | NOT_STARTED |  |  |  |
| M10 Submission package | NOT_STARTED |  |  |  |

## Current checkpoint

### Objective

Build the dependency-free M8 evidence foundation: versioned 14→30-day impact analysis, clause→rule→case→code traceability, and a reproducible partial evidence package whose verification status remains `FAIL` until real OPA, live GPT/Codex, security, browser, and deployment evidence exists.

### Failing or missing condition

No change-impact engine or evidence-pack generator exists. Required evidence files are absent, proof metrics are not consolidated, and current offline snapshots cannot yet be audited through one hashed manifest. Generating files must not convert reference-evaluator or test-double results into OPA/Codex claims.

### Planned actions

- [x] Re-read the M8 gate and inspect accepted policy, cases, differential, compiler, mutation, and worker snapshots.
- [x] Implement immutable 14→30 policy version change and changed-rule/case impact reporting.
- [x] Build clause→rule→case→code traceability with explicit uncovered links.
- [x] Generate every required evidence filename with provenance and truthful `NOT_RUN` external gates.
- [x] Compute a deterministic evidence manifest/hash and a human summary matching machine status.
- [x] Test missing/tampered evidence and unsupported PASS claims.
- [ ] Review the final diff and commit the M8 offline checkpoint.

### Completion evidence

- Commands: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm evidence:offline`; `node scripts/report-offline-m8.mjs`; `pnpm verify`
- Exit codes: focused implemented gates all 0; `pnpm verify` is 1 only because `test:e2e` and `submission:check` remain intentionally fail-closed
- Artifacts: `artifacts/evidence/` (25 files); `tests/snapshots/offline-m8-impact.json`; `schemas/verification-summary.v1.schema.json`
- Screenshots: not applicable; no UI implementation exists
- Commit: pending current checkpoint

## Checkpoint log

Append newest entries at the top. Keep entries compact and evidence-oriented.

### 2026-07-14 10:58 +09:00 — M8 offline impact and evidence foundation verified, commit pending

- Milestone: M8 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: made numeric case boundaries derive from PolicyIR; corrected stale golden/drift clause links; added immutable 14→30 version impact, traceability diagnostics, deterministic evidence generation, SHA-256 manifest validation, strict verification summary, and tamper/false-PASS tests
- Verified: unit 41/41; integration 14/14; eval 16/16; 8 case expectations change under 14→30; G02 blocks automatic verification; 4/4 clauses, 4/4 rules, 41/41 cases, and 6 code locations linked; 25 evidence files regenerate to hash `05e6f75a03fafa655f97c491983d3044e214f8a30c56fa31099762c095eee655`
- Recovered failure: first parallel integration run deleted the shared fixture build during evidence generation; classified as code concurrency; isolated evidence compilation under `.tmp/evidence-fixture-build`; retry passed 14/14
- Truth boundary: verification summary remains `FAIL`; OPA, live GPT-5.6, live Codex, post-repair drift, security, browser, container, and deployment are `NOT_RUN`
- Commit: pending current checkpoint

### 2026-07-14 10:42 +09:00 — M7 offline repair-worker foundation committed

- Milestone: M7 (offline contracts only; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict worker inputs/results, mode-tagged injected backend, fresh trusted-copy lifecycle, canonical hash guard, closed command IDs, sanitized child environment, time/output limits, bounded retry, independent review rules, three prompts, schema, and snapshot
- Verified: unit 37/37; integration 12/12; eval 14/14; real fresh-copy fixture test command passes; canonical baseline remains unchanged; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Safety evidence: traversal/absolute paths and unknown commands are rejected; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY` are absent from child environments; output secrets and personal home paths are redacted; high/critical review blocks proof
- Truth boundary: snapshot execution mode is `OFFLINE_TEST_DOUBLE` with `liveCodexClaim: false`; no SDK call, Codex patch, or live review is claimed
- Commit: `0c6fb85f392243a578eea0452b8de4ff50e58910`

### 2026-07-14 10:06 +09:00 — M6 offline differential runner committed

- Milestone: M6 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: preserved D01–D03 in the 41-case corpus; added typed differential records, per-case error isolation, deterministic defect clustering, strict schema, report CLI, integration/eval coverage, and before/after snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; integration 9/9; eval 11/11; baseline 25 matches, 16 drifts, 0 errors; fixed reference 41 matches, 0 drifts, 0 errors; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Diagnostic correction: the first run exposed five previously unclassified promotional approvals outside basic eligibility; these are now truthfully reported as `PROMOTION_ELIGIBILITY_BYPASS`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EXPECTATION_NOT_OPA`; no Codex repair claim or web drift UX exists
- Commit: `866bb205455945e0ee14afc8f776c1f5efe5b782`

### 2026-07-14 09:49 +09:00 — M5 offline case/conflict/mutation engines committed

- Milestone: M5 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added 38-case deterministic corpus, conflict/minimal-contrast analysis, 10 mutation operators, actual reference execution, strict schemas, and reviewable score snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; eval 9/9; 3 conflicts; 35 one-field contrasts; all rules reached; 44/47 mutants killed (93.62%); all 3 survivors listed; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, M5 report, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `66431fc9b8dabb93438fd8ab8d51336c0169eb87`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EVALUATOR_NOT_OPA`; Case Lab and OPA evidence are not implemented
- Next: include D01–D03 in the canonical corpus and build before/after fixture differential reports

### 2026-07-14 09:36 +09:00 — M4 deterministic Rego compiler committed

- Milestone: M4 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added pure Rego v1 generation, strict Rego input guard, exhaustive predicate helpers, priority exclusions, default fallback, compiler line mappings, snapshots, and compile CLI
- Verified: unit 25/25; 3,008-byte source and manifest are byte-stable; every predicate type covered; unresolved/invalid IR rejected; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, build, compile/manifest output, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `27a2b924d44bd900c28cb393e58e5413bb857445`
- Expected gap: no OPA binary is installed, so Rego compile and evaluation remain unverified
- Next: deterministic case/conflict/mutation engines using the clearly labeled reference evaluator

### 2026-07-14 09:26 +09:00 — M3 offline versioned ambiguity resolution committed

- Milestone: M3 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added immutable closed-patch application, versioned decision records, idempotent/revisit semantics, golden contradiction blocking, compile guard, and lifecycle transition table
- Verified: unit 20/20; all six patch operations covered; seeded decisions advance v1 to v4 without mutating the original; default-review conflicts with G02; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `506a8187bf5fd419122d8d5fdde54c7d77ab728f`
- Expected gap: SQLite persistence, server restart evidence, and Decision Queue UI remain for the pinned app stack
- Next: implement the pure deterministic Rego compiler and snapshots offline

### 2026-07-14 09:17 +09:00 — M2 offline PolicyIR and interpretation contracts committed

- Milestone: M2 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added exhaustive IR/patch types, strict semantic validation, fixed refund input schema, deterministic clause segmentation, diagnostic evaluator, strict JSON Schemas, interpreter prompt, recorded fixture, and eight-case eval corpus
- Verified: unit 11/11; eval 7/7; integration 5/5; all nine golden/drift examples agree with the diagnostic reference; unknown fields, executable predicates, dangling clauses, duplicate priorities, patch mismatch, and unsupported input fields are rejected
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, integration, demo replay, build, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e535209fb2f3f4bac00c0fe95bcfdd27c1296549`
- Expected gap: no claim of live GPT-5.6 work; recorded metadata is explicit; Zod/OpenAI dependencies and official API verification remain approval-gated
- Next: implement M3 patch/version/state logic offline

### 2026-07-14 08:59 +09:00 — M1 domain and deterministic seeded fixture passed

- Milestone: M1
- Change: added strict refund input validation, six golden cases, three drift witnesses, canonical buggy and evaluation-only fixed TypeScript fixtures, safe reset/copy hashing, fixture-local tests, and demo replay
- Verified: root unit 4/4; integration 5/5; fixture-local 4/4 in canonical and reset copies; typecheck, lint, eval, and build pass; `demo:run` reports exactly D01/D02/D03 drift; canonical baseline remains unchanged
- Commands: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; fixture-local `npm test`; `pnpm demo:reset`; `pnpm demo:run`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; `pnpm verify`; manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e509486d525c1f3a5825d39469298b70acb5025f`
- Expected failure: offline full verification still fails only browser and submission gates
- Risk: future Codex repair context must include only a fresh baseline copy and never the `expected-fixed` directory
- Next: M2 offline PolicyIR/schema/segmentation/prompt contracts; live interpretation remains network-approval gated

### 2026-07-14 08:45 +09:00 — Fail-closed M0 scaffold committed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: added a dependency-free pnpm workspace, strict TypeScript build, required root script surface, unit/integration/eval tests, README, and safe environment template
- Verified: offline install, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, M0 eval, build, manifest hashes, staged diff, and secret-pattern scan
- Commands: `pnpm install --offline`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; fail-closed gate commands; `git diff --cached --check`
- Commit: `c175d1c9e667dc98f258e36de11522479bc49ec0`
- Expected failures: `pnpm verify` fails only browser/submission gates; `pnpm verify:live` fails credentials/live integration; dev/demo commands fail because their later milestones are absent
- Risks: TypeScript is currently global rather than project-pinned; OPA and browser dependencies are absent; Docker daemon is stopped; official challenge and OpenAI/Codex facts remain unverified without approved network scope
- Next: continue independent M1 domain/fixture work, then use one approved network scope for official documentation and pinned dependency installation

### 2026-07-14 08:23 +09:00 — Preflight document-contract cleanup completed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: resolved all five document-contract defects; added Git safety/line-ending files; initialized `main`
- Verified: required control files read; stale contradiction phrases absent; `PolicyPatch` closed union present; offline/live gates separated; mutation threshold strict; current-branch/network boundary aligned; manifest/fences/M0–M10/goal length pass; staged diff clean; no credential-shaped values found
- Commands: environment/version commands; targeted `rg`; PowerShell manifest validator; `git diff --cached --check`; credential-shaped value scan
- Artifacts: updated control documents, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `PACK_MANIFEST.md`
- Commit: `38f8060cdb87c410f12e91d26b2d689ab1e07582`
- Risks: OPA is not installed; no `package.json` exists, so product lint/test/build/verify commands are not yet runnable; official online facts remain unverified because this checkpoint performs no network access
- Next: begin the remaining M0 product scaffold; request scoped network approval only when an install or official-document check is ready to run
