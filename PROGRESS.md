## Milestone board

Use one of: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED_P1`.

| Milestone | Status | Gate evidence | Commit | Remaining risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 Preflight and baseline | PASS | official rules/current implementation facts verified; exact stack and frozen offline install pass; checksum-pinned OPA 1.18.2 executes 41 accepted cases; security and clean-copy replay pass | `1d7261d` | Docker daemon remains unavailable but is outside the M0 gate |
| M1 Domain core and seeded fixture | PASS | strict validation; 4 unit tests; 5 integration tests; fixture-local 4-test suite; deterministic reset and exactly 3 seeded drifts | `e509486` | Evaluation-only fixed fixture must remain outside future Codex repair context |
| M2 PolicyIR and interpretation | IN_PROGRESS | strict server-only Responses adapter, provider-compatible structured schema, exact request/source/golden validation, bounded cancellation/retry controls, and unit tests pass | pending | credentials and a fresh GPT-5.6 response/evidence remain; live provider acceptance is not claimed |

| M10 Submission package | IN_PROGRESS | official rules/dates/track/requirements verified and generated rules-check updated; draft remains fail-closed | `130c355` | owner declarations, license, UI/screenshots, live/repo/video URLs, form, and confirmation remain unavailable |

## Current checkpoint

### Objective

Turn the validated complete-shape evidence directory into one byte-deterministic downloadable archive without adding a dependency, while preserving individual artifact downloads and excluding secrets or transient files by construction.

### Starting failing condition

The evidence generator produces 38 validated files and a SHA-256 manifest, but the Proof route exposes only 20 individual names and no archive. FR-16 requires a downloadable archive that excludes secrets and transient logs; the current UI therefore cannot deliver the complete proof package in one reviewable download.

The repository has no ZIP dependency and the dependency policy forbids adding one for a small deterministic function. The archive must be built only from the closed `REQUIRED_EVIDENCE_FILES` allowlist after semantic package validation, use stable ordering and metadata, and remain `FAIL / PARTIAL_OFFLINE` until live evidence genuinely exists.

### Planned actions

- [x] Close and commit the verified persisted Decision Queue/reference-bound Change Impact checkpoint and its ledger follow-up.
- [x] Map the existing evidence validator, manifest, download route, Proof UI, archive requirement, and container sequencing boundary.
- [x] Implement a dependency-free deterministic USTAR builder with closed safe paths, stable metadata, byte limits, and exact entry ordering.
- [x] Build archives only after complete semantic evidence validation and include exactly the 38 required files.
- [x] Expose all required individual evidence files plus a complete archive with safe content headers, deterministic ETag, and no-store behavior.
- [x] Add a prominent accessible Proof archive action without weakening the recorded-reference and partial-offline labels.
- [x] Add integration and browser coverage for archive determinism, contents, tamper rejection, headers, and individual-file completeness.
- [x] Update architecture, README, decisions, threat/limitation/runbook, and evidence documentation from actual behavior.
- [x] Run focused gates, inspect the Proof capture, and complete an independent adversarial diff review.
- [ ] Run the full gate, complete the final diff review, and commit the checkpoint on `main`.

### Completion evidence

- Starting baseline: implementation commit `16c06fc28f7948c3aa3d9748873b77ed3dbf81f6`; ledger commit `a359d80498ac52ff4e39ba9ec3dc3be669e57bc6`
- Starting gate: lint, strict typecheck, 63/63 unit, 22/22 integration, 21/21 eval, 3/3 production Chrome E2E, build, 264-file clean-copy, and 264-file/239-text-file security scan pass
- Starting expected failures: `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check` only
- Starting evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Container sequencing review: static readiness must remain separate from actual Linux build/start/health evidence; a verified Node base-image digest is not yet recorded, so no placeholder Dockerfile or false container `PASS` will be created in this checkpoint
- Focused current checks: strict typecheck; 25/25 integration including bounded disk reads, USTAR extraction, sensitive-content/path bypasses, and live Ed25519 archive enforcement; 3/3 production Chrome E2E including a native download, byte comparison, and all 38 individual routes; direct Proof screenshot inspection
- Recovered failures: an early missing-file assertion was aligned with the stricter exact-set guard; a quadratic credential regex and individual-download bypass were replaced with one linear common validation boundary; disk reads are now bounded before allocation; case/UNC/root/file-URI paths, camel/general secret keys, CR/LF values, short bearer tokens, invalid UTF-8, and symlinks have regression coverage; HTTPS remains allowed
- Independent review: final read-only review reports no P0/P1; the remaining P2 is repeated-download CPU/body-copy pressure for the currently 227 KiB package, which requires short caching or shared rate limiting before public multi-instance deployment
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` completed every local gate and failed only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`, each for an explicit owner/external/incomplete condition
- Final local evidence: 63/63 unit, 25/25 integration, 21/21 eval, 3/3 production Chrome E2E, production build, 269-file clean-copy replay, 269-file/244-text-file security scan, unchanged evidence hash, and 30 truthful submission gaps
- Commit: pending

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-07-14 21:08 +09:00 — Persisted Decision Queue and reference-bound Change Impact verified

- Milestones: M3 gate passes; M8 and M9 advance with a complete local v1-v5 reference flow but remain incomplete for archive/live/container/deployment work
- Change: added anonymous-session-isolated SQLite workspaces, replay-safe versioned decision/source routes, a one-card Decision Queue with revisit and focus management, a blocked 14-to-30 v5 draft, a sixth Change Impact view, and reference-policy meaning binding in Proof/Impact
- Security boundary: exact configured production origin/HTTPS, same-origin session creation, HttpOnly SameSite session/CSRF cookies, ten-second streamed body limit, 24-hour expiry enforced on GET and POST, 128-project cap, transactional cleanup, and fail-closed custom reset
- Recovered review findings: non-blocking stream cancellation, newest-first self-referencing SQLite deletion, bounded anonymous storage, production captures without a dev overlay, alternate-v4 proof mismatch blocking, and expired-token POST rejection
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 63 unit; 22 integration; 21 eval; 3 production Chrome E2E; production build; deterministic evidence hash; 264-file clean-copy replay; 264-file/239-text-file security scan
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`; the submission checker reports 30 truthful unmet requirements
- Evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Commit: `16c06fc28f7948c3aa3d9748873b77ed3dbf81f6`
- Next: implement the remaining offline-safe Codex SDK adapter/container/archive prerequisites before requesting owner-only credentials, license acceptance, deployment, and submission actions

### 2026-07-14 19:13 +09:00 — Five-view workspace and authenticated evidence boundary verified

- Milestones: M4, M5, and M6 gates pass; M2, M3, and M8 advance but remain incomplete pending live/write/impact flows
- Change: added a strict GPT-5.6 Responses adapter contract and protected route; complete drift-report validation; five evidence-backed Next.js views and APIs; manifest-verified downloads; explicit error/loading/not-found states; Chrome E2E; six screenshots; responsive navigation; social preview; structured external proof receipts; semantic evidence recomputation; and a trusted Ed25519 live-attestation boundary
- Security boundary: live interpretation requires a server token, 128 KB body limit, one active run, 60-second cancellation, no SDK retries, two bounded schema attempts, generic external errors, exact request/source identity, and golden-case agreement
- Recovered failures: clean-copy replay found incremental fixture compilation could report success after deleting emitted JavaScript; fixture builds are now non-incremental and assert both outputs exist. Adversarial review then proved a self-rehashed package could forge live PASS; the exact attack and semantic variants are now regression tests and fail closed.
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 56 unit; 21 integration; 21 eval; 2 Chrome E2E; production build; deterministic evidence generation; 247-file clean-copy replay; 247-file/228-text-file static security scan
- Independent review: no unresolved P0/P1 remained after moving the one-run reservation before body reads, enforcing streamed byte limits, and regenerating all hash-bound artifacts.
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`, each for an explicit owner/external/incomplete condition
- Evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Commit: `eae20ed5d92358361c449764ade91c74d7f2d4ba`
- Next: checkpoint the verified changes, then implement remaining independent M3/M8 write and impact surfaces before requesting owner-only live/license/deployment actions

### 2026-07-14 15:47 +09:00 — M0 official preflight and real OPA gate verified

- Milestone: M0 PASS; M4 engine gate PASS while UI portion remains in progress
- Change: verified official challenge rules and Developer Tools track; confirmed cached Devpost package is not callable; installed exact Next/OpenAI/Codex/Zod/Playwright stack; added checksum-pinned OPA 1.18.2 installer/runner/evidence; refreshed submission, license, container, and security truth boundaries
- Verified: frozen offline install; production audit 0 vulnerabilities after PostCSS 8.5.19 override; lint; TypeScript; 49 unit; 17 integration including 41 OPA cases; 21 eval; build; 200-file clean-copy replay; 200-file/198-text-file security scan; D01–D03 replay
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, `submission:check`, and `test:e2e`, each for an explicit incomplete/owner/external condition
- Evidence hash: `2dc9b83479eae24d6086dd76c46bd1d07b4ceb64d2e82b229b6b7fbd4692a111`
- Commit: `1d7261d0f41201e8501558d8b59368605d258db1`
- Next: review and commit this checkpoint, then implement the server-side GPT-5.6 adapter and five-screen Next.js workspace without claiming live model evidence until credentials exist

Append newest entries at the top. Keep entries compact and evidence-oriented.

### 2026-07-14 12:38 +09:00 — M3 persisted workspace service verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline server-service subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added a repository port and framework-independent service for complete current-workspace reads, immutable policy-text `DRAFT` versions, and atomic ambiguity resolution
- Verified: unit 49/49 and integration 15/15; new text preserves authoritative golden cases and prior source; repeated choices are idempotent; stale expected versions and contradictory default-review choices do not create versions; three service-driven decisions survive SQLite close/reopen
- Commands: `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/workspace/service.ts`, `tests/unit/policy-workspace-service.test.mjs`, updated `tests/integration/policy-persistence.integration.test.mjs`
- Commit: `85259ea1e70449c1307b382e3f2541fb7e8c2327`
- Risks: no HTTP route or Decision Queue UI exists; those require the approved pinned Next.js application stack
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit, then re-audit remaining offline P0 work

### 2026-07-14 12:14 +09:00 — M3 offline SQLite persistence foundation verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline persistence subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict golden-case parsing and a transactional SQLite repository for projects, immutable versions, validated IR, lifecycle state, and ambiguity decision records
- Verified: unit 46/46 and integration 15/15; four versions, three reproducible decisions, policy text, golden cases, and `COMPILED` state survive a close/reopen; stale parents, silent resolutions, unrelated decision edits, invalid clause/source links, and corrupted JSON fail closed
- Recovered failures: first Windows test cleanup attempted to delete an open SQLite file and was fixed by closing before recursive cleanup; a later full run found `submission:draft` removed its tracked checker report before security scanning, so draft generation now writes an accurate `NOT_RUN` report and the scanner reports missing tracked files instead of crashing
- Truth boundary: local Node 22 `node:sqlite` is experimental; production runtime/volume behavior and web/API integration remain unverified
- Commands: local `node:sqlite` probe; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/persistence/sqlite.ts`, `src/domain/case-validation.ts`, persistence unit/integration tests
- Commit: `9e293e00e06e71adcf2789e89b330af848150825`
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit this checkpoint, then continue approved external integration work

### 2026-07-14 11:48 +09:00 — M10 offline submission foundation verified

- Milestone: M10 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added evidence-derived English submission/demo drafts, machine-readable readiness state, strict fail-closed submission validation, unit/eval coverage, and a Git-history scanner self-pattern exclusion
- Verified: 21 submission and 4 demo files generated with mandatory non-final markers; checker reports exactly 37 independent unmet requirements; unit 43/43, integration 14/14, eval 21/21, security 188/188 files and 186 text files with zero findings, clean-copy replay 188 files, build, and three-drift demo all pass
- Commands: `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `artifacts/submission/`, `artifacts/demo/`, `artifacts/security/security-report.json`, `artifacts/security/clean-checkout-report.json`
- Commit: `130c3553abdd1ad668d8c367c0f819d242962029`
- Risks: M10 remains incomplete until current official rules, live proof, owner-selected license, UI screenshots, video, HTTPS URLs, form data, and confirmation exist
- Next: commit this offline checkpoint, then obtain one scoped network approval for current official documentation and pinned dependency/OPA work

### 2026-07-14 11:33 +09:00 — M9 offline security and reproducibility foundation committed

- Milestone: M9 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added architecture/threat/limitations/runbook/license-review docs, NOTICE, current+history secret/path/unsafe-process scan, fail-closed license/container checks, container prerequisites, and isolated clean-copy reproduction
- Verified: security scan PASS across 158 files, 156 text files, and full Git history with zero findings; clean copy PASS across frozen offline install, lint, typecheck, 41 unit, 14 integration, 19 eval, build, reset, drift replay, and evidence regeneration; no credential variables forwarded
- Expected failures: project LICENSE requires owner acceptance; container lacks verified OPA, Dockerfile, health route, and running daemon; browser and submission remain absent
- Recovered failures: history patch scanning falsely joined empty `.env.example` values and was replaced by commit-tree scanning; clean-copy eval self-reference was made explicit as `IN_PROGRESS` until the outer run writes PASS
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails exactly `license:check`, `container:check`, `test:e2e`, and `submission:check`

### 2026-07-14 11:06 +09:00 — M8 offline impact and evidence foundation committed

- Milestone: M8 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: made numeric case boundaries derive from PolicyIR; corrected stale golden/drift clause links; added immutable 14→30 version impact, traceability diagnostics, deterministic evidence generation, SHA-256 manifest validation, strict verification summary, and tamper/false-PASS tests
- Verified: unit 41/41; integration 14/14; eval 16/16; 8 case expectations change under 14→30; G02 blocks automatic verification; 4/4 clauses, 4/4 rules, 41/41 cases, and 6 code locations linked; 25 evidence files regenerate to hash `05e6f75a03fafa655f97c491983d3044e214f8a30c56fa31099762c095eee655`
- Recovered failure: first parallel integration run deleted the shared fixture build during evidence generation; classified as code concurrency; isolated evidence compilation under `.tmp/evidence-fixture-build`; retry passed 14/14
- Truth boundary: verification summary remains `FAIL`; OPA, live GPT-5.6, live Codex, post-repair drift, security, browser, container, and deployment are `NOT_RUN`
- Commit: `efff64154be5645fed1a15bf564bdb849a608cf6`

### 2026-07-14 10:42 +09:00 — M7 offline repair-worker foundation committed

- Milestone: M7 (offline contracts only; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict worker inputs/results, mode-tagged injected backend, fresh trusted-copy lifecycle, canonical hash guard, closed command IDs, sanitized child environment, time/output limits, bounded retry, independent review rules, three prompts, schema, and snapshot
- Verified: unit 37/37; integration 12/12; eval 14/14; real fresh-copy fixture test command passes; canonical baseline remains unchanged; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Safety evidence: traversal/absolute paths and unknown commands are rejected; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY` are absent from child environments; output secrets and personal home paths are redacted; high/critical review blocks proof
- Truth boundary: snapshot execution mode is `OFFLINE_TEST_DOUBLE` with `liveCodexClaim: false`; no SDK call, Codex patch, or live review is claimed
- Commit: `0c6fb85f392243a578eea0452b8de4ff50e58910`

### 2026-07-14 10:06 +09:00 — M6 offline differential runner committed

- Milestone: M6 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: preserved D01–D03 in the 41-case corpus; added typed differential records, per-case error isolation, deterministic defect clustering, strict schema, report CLI, integration/eval coverage, and before/after snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; integration 9/9; eval 11/11; baseline 25 matches, 16 drifts, 0 errors; fixed reference 41 matches, 0 drifts, 0 errors; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Diagnostic correction: the first run exposed five previously unclassified promotional approvals outside basic eligibility; these are now truthfully reported as `PROMOTION_ELIGIBILITY_BYPASS`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EXPECTATION_NOT_OPA`; no Codex repair claim or web drift UX exists
- Commit: `866bb205455945e0ee14afc8f776c1f5efe5b782`

### 2026-07-14 09:49 +09:00 — M5 offline case/conflict/mutation engines committed

- Milestone: M5 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added 38-case deterministic corpus, conflict/minimal-contrast analysis, 10 mutation operators, actual reference execution, strict schemas, and reviewable score snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; eval 9/9; 3 conflicts; 35 one-field contrasts; all rules reached; 44/47 mutants killed (93.62%); all 3 survivors listed; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, M5 report, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `66431fc9b8dabb93438fd8ab8d51336c0169eb87`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EVALUATOR_NOT_OPA`; Case Lab and OPA evidence are not implemented
- Next: include D01–D03 in the canonical corpus and build before/after fixture differential reports

### 2026-07-14 09:36 +09:00 — M4 deterministic Rego compiler committed

- Milestone: M4 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added pure Rego v1 generation, strict Rego input guard, exhaustive predicate helpers, priority exclusions, default fallback, compiler line mappings, snapshots, and compile CLI
- Verified: unit 25/25; 3,008-byte source and manifest are byte-stable; every predicate type covered; unresolved/invalid IR rejected; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, build, compile/manifest output, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `27a2b924d44bd900c28cb393e58e5413bb857445`
- Expected gap: no OPA binary is installed, so Rego compile and evaluation remain unverified
- Next: deterministic case/conflict/mutation engines using the clearly labeled reference evaluator

### 2026-07-14 09:26 +09:00 — M3 offline versioned ambiguity resolution committed

- Milestone: M3 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added immutable closed-patch application, versioned decision records, idempotent/revisit semantics, golden contradiction blocking, compile guard, and lifecycle transition table
- Verified: unit 20/20; all six patch operations covered; seeded decisions advance v1 to v4 without mutating the original; default-review conflicts with G02; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `506a8187bf5fd419122d8d5fdde54c7d77ab728f`
- Expected gap: SQLite persistence, server restart evidence, and Decision Queue UI remain for the pinned app stack
- Next: implement the pure deterministic Rego compiler and snapshots offline

### 2026-07-14 09:17 +09:00 — M2 offline PolicyIR and interpretation contracts committed

- Milestone: M2 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added exhaustive IR/patch types, strict semantic validation, fixed refund input schema, deterministic clause segmentation, diagnostic evaluator, strict JSON Schemas, interpreter prompt, recorded fixture, and eight-case eval corpus
- Verified: unit 11/11; eval 7/7; integration 5/5; all nine golden/drift examples agree with the diagnostic reference; unknown fields, executable predicates, dangling clauses, duplicate priorities, patch mismatch, and unsupported input fields are rejected
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, integration, demo replay, build, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e535209fb2f3f4bac00c0fe95bcfdd27c1296549`
- Expected gap: no claim of live GPT-5.6 work; recorded metadata is explicit; Zod/OpenAI dependencies and official API verification remain approval-gated
- Next: implement M3 patch/version/state logic offline

### 2026-07-14 08:59 +09:00 — M1 domain and deterministic seeded fixture passed

- Milestone: M1
- Change: added strict refund input validation, six golden cases, three drift witnesses, canonical buggy and evaluation-only fixed TypeScript fixtures, safe reset/copy hashing, fixture-local tests, and demo replay
- Verified: root unit 4/4; integration 5/5; fixture-local 4/4 in canonical and reset copies; typecheck, lint, eval, and build pass; `demo:run` reports exactly D01/D02/D03 drift; canonical baseline remains unchanged
- Commands: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; fixture-local `npm test`; `pnpm demo:reset`; `pnpm demo:run`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; `pnpm verify`; manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e509486d525c1f3a5825d39469298b70acb5025f`
- Expected failure: offline full verification still fails only browser and submission gates
- Risk: future Codex repair context must include only a fresh baseline copy and never the `expected-fixed` directory
- Next: M2 offline PolicyIR/schema/segmentation/prompt contracts; live interpretation remains network-approval gated

### 2026-07-14 08:45 +09:00 — Fail-closed M0 scaffold committed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: added a dependency-free pnpm workspace, strict TypeScript build, required root script surface, unit/integration/eval tests, README, and safe environment template
- Verified: offline install, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, M0 eval, build, manifest hashes, staged diff, and secret-pattern scan
- Commands: `pnpm install --offline`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; fail-closed gate commands; `git diff --cached --check`
- Commit: `c175d1c9e667dc98f258e36de11522479bc49ec0`
- Expected failures: `pnpm verify` fails only browser/submission gates; `pnpm verify:live` fails credentials/live integration; dev/demo commands fail because their later milestones are absent
- Risks: TypeScript is currently global rather than project-pinned; OPA and browser dependencies are absent; Docker daemon is stopped; official challenge and OpenAI/Codex facts remain unverified without approved network scope
- Next: continue independent M1 domain/fixture work, then use one approved network scope for official documentation and pinned dependency installation

### 2026-07-14 08:23 +09:00 — Preflight document-contract cleanup completed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: resolved all five document-contract defects; added Git safety/line-ending files; initialized `main`
- Verified: required control files read; stale contradiction phrases absent; `PolicyPatch` closed union present; offline/live gates separated; mutation threshold strict; current-branch/network boundary aligned; manifest/fences/M0–M10/goal length pass; staged diff clean; no credential-shaped values found
- Commands: environment/version commands; targeted `rg`; PowerShell manifest validator; `git diff --cached --check`; credential-shaped value scan
- Artifacts: updated control documents, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `PACK_MANIFEST.md`
- Commit: `38f8060cdb87c410f12e91d26b2d689ab1e07582`
- Risks: OPA is not installed; no `package.json` exists, so product lint/test/build/verify commands are not yet runnable; official online facts remain unverified because this checkpoint performs no network access
- Next: begin the remaining M0 product scaffold; request scoped network approval only when an install or official-document check is ready to run

## Active blockers

A blocker is valid only when the task cannot continue safely without external input. Continue all independent work first.

| ID | Type | Exact blocker | Work already completed | One owner action | Resume condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-000 | None | No active blocker for the current offline checkpoint | All approved independent work continues | None | Continue the checkpoint |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner/status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deadline compression | Medium | High | Preserve P0 vertical slice; cut only P1 | Codex / open |
| Live model/API outage | Medium | Medium | Keep recorded verified evidence clearly labeled | Codex / open |
| Hosted worker restrictions | Medium | High | Use container/VM host or split worker | Codex / open |
| Codex SDK/live adapter mismatch | Medium | High | Current package/docs are pinned; validate the real adapter with fresh SDK evidence | Codex / open |
| Live attestation key custody | Medium | High | Keep private key outside Git/logs/evidence; inject only trusted public keys into verification | Codex / open |
| Repeated evidence-download pressure | Low locally / Medium when public | Medium | Exact 4 MiB/16 MiB bounds and one active archive build exist; add short metadata-keyed caching or shared rate limiting before public deployment | Codex / M9 open |
| Docker daemon unavailable | High | Medium | Continue non-container gates; start Docker Desktop before the container gate | Owner/Codex / open |
| Offline validator/Zod duplication | Medium | Medium | Cross-check both contracts and generate JSON Schema from the pinned runtime schema after network approval | Codex / open |
| Demo recording/account blocker | Medium | Medium | Prepare script, captions, screenshots, and exact owner action | Codex / open |

## Decisions pending

Link to IDs in `DECISIONS.md`.

- Project license selection requires owner acceptance; see D-013 and `docs/license-review.md`.

## Next action

`Commit the verified M8 archive checkpoint, then continue the remaining offline-safe Codex SDK adapter and static container prerequisites before owner-only live/license/deployment actions.`

## Pause handoff

Fill before `/goal pause` or any handoff.

- Why paused: `not paused; the M8 archive checkpoint is in final full verification`
- Exact current state: `the recorded v4 package has a deterministic guarded 38-file USTAR download and complete individual API surface; live work remains fail-closed`
- Last successful command: `pnpm verify completed every local gate; 63 unit, 25 integration, 21 eval, 3 browser, clean-copy, security, and production build passed`
- Current failing command: `none for the focused archive checkpoint; pnpm verify still intentionally retains license, container, and submission release failures`
- Uncommitted files: `M8 archive implementation, tests, Proof capture, generated drafts, and documentation awaiting full verification and checkpoint commit`
- Safe resume command/action: `review the final diff, commit the M8 archive checkpoint on main, and continue M7/M9`
- One owner action, if any: `none`

## Final completion record

Do not fill until the end.

- Engineering definition of done: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- `pnpm verify`: `FAIL_EXPECTED — license, container, and submission only`
- `pnpm verify:live`: `FAIL — fresh GPT/Codex integration and credentials absent`
- Production deployment: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Public repository: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Demo video: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Challenge submission: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Final evidence hash: `UNSET`
- Final commit/tag: `UNSET`
- Final truthful state: `NOT_STARTED`
