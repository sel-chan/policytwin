## Current checkpoint

### Objective

Implement and verify a real mutually authenticated TLS transport and bounded external supervisor service for the existing single-run Codex repair RPC while keeping every host-process live SDK/command path disabled. This checkpoint may prove peer authentication, frame handling, replay rejection, and supervisor lifecycle with local test certificates; it must not claim an OS-isolated worker, live Codex call, fresh evidence, running production container, or deployment.

### Starting failing condition

At checkpoint start, the signed RPC contract and validating client were covered by test doubles, but `ExternalWorkerRpcTransport.authenticationMode` was only a declarative string. There was no socket implementation, certificate validation, framed request/response I/O, supervisor listener, connection/request concurrency limit, transport-level deadline, or integration proof that an unauthenticated peer and oversized frame are rejected before allocation. The worktree was clean at `146b0ed`; Node 22.22.2 and pnpm 11.7.0 were available, credentials were unset, and no system `openssl` command was on `PATH`.

### Planned actions

- [x] Re-read all required control documents, inspect the clean `main` worktree, environment, local SDK/manual cache, and current RPC boundary.
- [x] Complete independent read-only mTLS, worker-SDK reuse, and worker-container threat reviews.
- [x] Add a Node built-in TLS client transport with strict server identity, CA trust, exact certificate fingerprint pinning, bounded fixed-width frame headers, and abort-aware socket teardown.
- [x] Add a mutually authenticated supervisor listener with exact client identity, pre-parse request caps, one in-flight repair, request-ID/nonce replay protection, deadline enforcement, and bounded canonical response frames.
- [x] Keep the supervisor executor injectable so offline integration tests use an explicit signed `FAIL` test double while the host remains unable to construct the live SDK.
- [x] Add negative integration coverage for missing/untrusted/incorrect certificates, identity mismatch, malformed/oversized/partial/trailing frames, replay, concurrency, timeout, shutdown, pre-handshake sockets, and close-versus-admission races.
- [x] Persist replay state transactionally in SQLite across supervisor restart and reject reuse of either request ID or nonce.
- [x] Document the proven transport boundary separately from the still-unproven OS worker/container, OpenAI-only egress, fixture no-network execution, and fresh live evidence.
- [x] Run focused tests, lint, typecheck, full offline verification, fail-closed live/container probes, and independent final review.
- [x] Commit the coherent checkpoint and record its hash.

### Completion evidence

- Starting HEAD: `146b0ed`; clean `main` worktree.
- Prior verified baseline: lint, strict typecheck, 105 unit assertions, 31 integration assertions, 22 eval assertions, 3 production Chrome E2E tests, static container checks, security, clean-copy replay, and production build passed. `pnpm verify` retained only the owner-selected project license and 30-item non-final submission failures.
- Current expected failures: OS-isolated worker, worker image, OpenAI-only egress proxy, immutable no-network verification compartment, immutable Node base digest, daemon-backed container verification, live GPT/Codex evidence, owner-selected license, deployment, media/public URLs, and submission remain absent.
- Environment evidence: Node 22.22.2, pnpm 11.7.0, Docker CLI present with prior daemon failure, no system `openssl` on `PATH`, all host OpenAI/worker credential variables unset, and the same-day official Codex manual cache available.
- Transport result: real loopback TLS 1.3 requires the configured CA, server-name verification, exact SHA-256 peer certificate pins, and fixed `policytwin-worker-rpc/1` ALPN. One `PTQ1` request and `PTS1` response use an eight-byte magic/length header with 1 MiB/4 MiB pre-body caps and canonical UTF-8/JSON.
- Supervisor result: one active repair, deadline/disconnect/shutdown cancellation, executor-settlement wait, pre-handshake socket cleanup, close-versus-replay-admission rejection, exact signed response construction, and bounded diagnostics are implemented. The integration executor returns only `OFFLINE_TEST_DOUBLE_NO_LIVE_WORKER` as a signed `FAIL`; no live claim is possible.
- Replay result: the production-oriented SQLite store uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, unique request ID and nonce constraints, expiry pruning, capacity limits, full synchronous durability, absolute non-memory paths, and survives close/reopen. The in-memory store remains explicitly ephemeral.
- Focused verification: 15/15 real mTLS/replay integration assertions pass. Test certificates are generated temporarily with local OpenSSL and deleted; no private TLS key is committed.
- Harness recovery: integration tests now run serially because evidence tests intentionally rebuild shared `dist`/fixture/evidence outputs. This removed the Windows process/file race. A pre-existing attestation test now supplies its fixed verification clock for the missing-trust assertion instead of depending on wall time.
- Full verification: lint, strict typecheck, 105/105 unit assertions, 46/46 integration assertions, 22/22 eval assertions, 3/3 Chrome E2E tests, 286-file clean-copy replay, 261-text-file plus Git-history security scan, demo reset/run, static container contract, and production build pass. `pnpm verify` fails only owner-selected `LICENSE` and the exact 30-item non-final `submission:check`.
- Fail-closed external probes: `pnpm verify:live` fails only at missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CODEX_MODEL`; `pnpm container:verify` fails before build because the immutable Node 22.22.2 image is unset.
- Independent final audit: no new P0/P1 was found after pre-handshake socket tracking, close-versus-admission rejection, executor settlement waiting, persistent request-ID/nonce replay rejection, and documentation truth-boundary updates. The audit confirms that OS worker/runtime and live evidence remain unimplemented.
- Current checkpoint results: `IMPLEMENTED_AND_VERIFIED_OFFLINE` at `b7b3cf94b722a7bc267d0565b43522d73b1527f9`.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-07-15 13:51 +09:00 — Real mTLS supervisor transport and durable replay boundary verified offline

- Milestones: M7 and M9 remain `IN_PROGRESS`; this checkpoint completes real authenticated transport and supervisor admission/lifecycle controls, not the OS-isolated Codex worker, live repair, dynamic container, deployment, or submission
- Transport change: added TLS 1.3-only mutual authentication with configured CA material, standard server-name verification, exact client/server SHA-256 certificate pins, fixed `policytwin-worker-rpc/1` ALPN, and one bounded `PTQ1`/`PTS1` canonical frame per connection
- Supervisor change: added pre-body 1 MiB/4 MiB declarations, canonical UTF-8/JSON parsing, one active repair, deadline/disconnect/shutdown cancellation, pre-handshake socket tracking, executor-settlement waiting, close-versus-replay-admission rejection, server-owned Ed25519 response construction, and generic diagnostics
- Replay change: added transactional SQLite replay state with absolute non-memory paths, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, unique request-ID and nonce constraints, capacity/expiry pruning, full synchronous durability, and reopen verification; the bounded in-memory store is explicitly ephemeral
- Test change: added ephemeral OpenSSL certificate generation with no committed private keys; 15 focused mTLS/replay assertions cover trusted success-to-signed-FAIL, missing/wrong/untrusted identity, name/pin/ALPN, oversized/partial/trailing frames, replay, concurrency, timeout, shutdown, pre-handshake sockets, admission races, durable reopen, path rejection, capacity, and expiry
- Harness recovery: integration tests now run serially because evidence-package tests intentionally rebuild shared `dist`/fixture/evidence outputs; the pre-existing live-attestation test now uses its fixed clock for the missing-trust assertion
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 105/105 unit; 46/46 integration; 22/22 eval; 3/3 production Chrome E2E; 286-file clean-copy replay; 261-text-file plus Git-history security scan; demo reset/run; static container contract; production build; truthful fail-closed submission drafts
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` passes every implemented code/static gate and fails only owner-selected `LICENSE` plus the exact 30-item non-final `submission:check`; `pnpm verify:live` fails at missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CODEX_MODEL`; `pnpm container:verify` fails at the unset immutable Node image digest
- Independent audit: no P0/P1 remains in the mTLS/replay checkpoint; it explicitly confirms that worker image, fixture-only mounts, egress proxy, immutable verifier, kernel resource/process-tree enforcement, certificate operations, and live SDK evidence are still missing
- Evidence: partial evidence hash remains `4b046b707d238da3d5de04e86bcf3e7218af81d301f0f3186e041a5c0b4cdbf1` (`PARTIAL_OFFLINE/FAIL`); local integration certificates and signing keys are test-only and temporary
- Commit: `b7b3cf94b722a7bc267d0565b43522d73b1527f9`
- Next: implement a separately built non-privileged worker runtime, fixture-only repair mount, OpenAI-only egress proxy contract, and credential-free `--network=none` immutable verification compartment without enabling host live execution

### 2026-07-15 08:14 +09:00 — External worker RPC and static web-container boundaries verified offline

- Milestones: M7 and M9 remain `IN_PROGRESS`; this checkpoint completes the host RPC client contract and static web-container prerequisites, not the external worker, live Codex run, dynamic container, or deployment
- RPC change: added one complete-run canonical request/response protocol, declared-length asynchronous receive contract, 4 MiB/64 KiB/1,024-chunk limits, single-use request/nonce/expiry/replay checks, trusted Ed25519 supervisor receipts, exact worker/policy/corpus bindings, cleanup proof, and host-known baseline versus signed final path/kind/mode/mtime/file-hash manifest comparison that permits only `src/refund.ts` and `tests/refund.test.mjs`
- Container change: added `.dockerignore`, split standalone web Dockerfile with no worker/credentials or mutable base fallback, daemon-free static validation, and a dynamic verifier prepared to check immutable build input, OPA digest, loopback health, non-root/read-only/resource limits, named-volume ownership, an actual API SQLite mutation across restart, and cleanup failures
- Truth boundary: `authenticationMode` is only an interface precondition; no mTLS/socket-ACL transport, external supervisor/worker image, SDK turn, worker credential, or live response exists. `container:check` passes only `STATIC_WEB_CONTAINER`; `container:verify` remains `DYNAMIC_WEB_CONTAINER/FAIL` because the immutable Node image digest is unset and therefore does not reach the unavailable daemon.
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 105/105 unit assertions; 31/31 integration; 22/22 eval; 3/3 production Chrome E2E; 281-file clean-copy replay; 256-text-file plus Git-history security scan; demo reset/run; static container contract; production build; generated fail-closed submission drafts
- Independent review: RPC, container, and consistency reviews found no remaining P0/P1 after receive preallocation/chunk controls, exact manifest/mtime delta binding, mutable Docker build-argument rejection, SQLite API restart verification, signal cleanup, and cleanup-failure propagation were corrected
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` passes every implemented code/static gate and fails only owner-selected `LICENSE` plus the exact 30-item non-final `submission:check`; `pnpm verify:live` fails closed at missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CODEX_MODEL`
- Evidence: `artifacts/security/container-static-report.json` is static `PASS`; `artifacts/security/container-report.json` is dynamic `FAIL`; evidence hash remains `4b046b707d238da3d5de04e86bcf3e7218af81d301f0f3186e041a5c0b4cdbf1` (`PARTIAL_OFFLINE/FAIL`)
- Commit: `24a524629424f2480c6793861c3bcc0ce99f660e`
- Next: implement the authentication-enforcing transport and external supervisor/worker runtime without enabling host live execution; verify an immutable Node base-image digest only within an explicitly approved registry scope

### 2026-07-15 02:21 +09:00 — Fail-closed Codex SDK-compatible adapter contract verified offline

- Milestone: M7 remains `IN_PROGRESS`; the offline adapter and evidence contract are complete, while live execution is intentionally blocked pending a real external OS-sandbox worker RPC
- Change: added strict model-only phase schemas; separate cartography/repair/review streams; server-owned SDK metadata; exact two-file and D01-D03 digest enforcement; exact 41-case corpus execution receipt; command/tree/PolicyIR/run bindings; canonical before/after receipt-bound diff; all-phase workspace poisoning; unknown SDK lifecycle rejection; sensitive prompt, fixture, command, DSN/URI, diff, and archive guards; and unconditional host live-factory rejection
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 80/80 unit; 31/31 integration; 21/21 eval; 3/3 production Chrome E2E; 273-file clean-copy replay; 248-text-file plus Git-history security scan; production build; deterministic evidence and submission draft generation
- Independent review: final M7 contract and adversarial security reviews found no remaining P0/P1 after the host factory, all-phase poison, lifecycle allowlist, credential URI, canonical diff, and fixed corpus corrections
- Recovered failures: parallel unit/integration builds contended on Windows `dist` and produced `EPERM`; serial reruns passed. The first review-poison test exposed a missing `await` around the read-only Promise; the catch boundary was corrected and the regression now passes. Prettier is not installed, so the attempted optional formatter command failed; canonical lint passes.
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` passes every local engineering check and fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`; `pnpm verify:live` separately fails closed for missing credentials/model, external worker, and fresh evidence
- Evidence hash: `4b046b707d238da3d5de04e86bcf3e7218af81d301f0f3186e041a5c0b4cdbf1`
- Expected release gaps: owner-selected LICENSE; Dockerfile/running daemon; external Codex worker; fresh GPT-5.6/Codex calls; signed live proof; two remaining captures; public URLs/video; submission confirmation
- Commit: `5b1006f9b76362e919beb96096988ebac0b7d9f9`
- Next: implement independently safe container prerequisites and the external-worker RPC design without enabling host live execution

### 2026-07-14 22:34 +09:00 — Deterministic complete evidence archive verified

- Milestone: M8 advances with the required downloadable archive; it remains in progress only for fresh live proof, signing, and final submission captures
- Change: added a dependency-free fixed-metadata USTAR builder, exact 38-file download allowlist, bounded regular-file UTF-8 reader, common semantic/sensitive-content validation, complete individual evidence API, native Proof download action, and truthful generated submission copy
- Security boundary: 4 MiB per file and 16 MiB aggregate limits apply before parsing; symlinks/non-files, invalid UTF-8, missing/extra/tampered payloads, credential/private-key/bearer/OpenAI-token content, absolute/personal/file-URI paths, and untrusted or invalid live attestations fail closed; one archive build runs per process at a time
- Recovered review findings: replaced a quadratic secret regex, closed the individual-download bypass, bounded disk allocation, covered camel/general credential keys and CR/LF values, expanded Windows/UNC/POSIX path detection without rejecting HTTPS, and verified a real browser download plus all 38 individual routes
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 63 unit; 25 integration; 21 eval; 3 production Chrome E2E; production build; 269-file clean-copy replay; 269-file/244-text-file security scan; direct Proof screenshot inspection; independent final review reports no P0/P1
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`; the submission checker reports 30 truthful unmet requirements
- Evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Commit: `5fecdded3f2bcec43c2fe6cf20bf93afdaccba10`
- Residual: repeated public downloads need short metadata-keyed caching or shared rate limiting before deployment; the current package is approximately 227 KiB and remains bounded/fail-closed
- Next: implement the offline-safe server-side Codex SDK adapter, then return to static container prerequisites once a verified base-image digest is within approved network scope

### 2026-07-14 21:08 +09:00 — Persisted Decision Queue and reference-bound Change Impact verified

- Milestones: M3 gate passes; M8 and M9 advance with a complete local v1-v5 reference flow but remain incomplete for archive/live/container/deployment work
- Change: added anonymous-session-isolated SQLite workspaces, replay-safe versioned decision/source routes, a one-card Decision Queue with revisit and focus management, a blocked 14-to-30 v5 draft, a sixth Change Impact view, and reference-policy meaning binding in Proof/Impact
- Security boundary: exact configured production origin/HTTPS, same-origin session creation, HttpOnly SameSite session/CSRF cookies, ten-second streamed body limit, 24-hour expiry enforced on GET and POST, 128-project cap, transactional cleanup, and fail-closed custom reset
- Recovered review findings: non-blocking stream cancellation, newest-first self-referencing SQLite deletion, bounded anonymous storage, production captures without a dev overlay, alternate-v4 proof mismatch blocking, and expired-token POST rejection
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 63 unit; 22 integration; 21 eval; 3 production Chrome E2E; production build; deterministic evidence hash; 264-file clean-copy replay; 264-file/239-text-file security scan
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`; the submission checker reports 30 truthful unmet requirements
- Evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Commit: `16c06fc28f7948c3aa3d9748873b77ed3dbf81f6`
- Next: implement the remaining offline-safe Codex SDK adapter/container/archive prerequisites before requesting owner-only credentials, license acceptance, deployment, and submission actions

### 2026-07-14 19:13 +09:00 — Five-view workspace and authenticated evidence boundary verified

- Milestones: M4, M5, and M6 gates pass; M2, M3, and M8 advance but remain incomplete pending live/write/impact flows
- Change: added a strict GPT-5.6 Responses adapter contract and protected route; complete drift-report validation; five evidence-backed Next.js views and APIs; manifest-verified downloads; explicit error/loading/not-found states; Chrome E2E; six screenshots; responsive navigation; social preview; structured external proof receipts; semantic evidence recomputation; and a trusted Ed25519 live-attestation boundary
- Security boundary: live interpretation requires a server token, 128 KB body limit, one active run, 60-second cancellation, no SDK retries, two bounded schema attempts, generic external errors, exact request/source identity, and golden-case agreement
- Recovered failures: clean-copy replay found incremental fixture compilation could report success after deleting emitted JavaScript; fixture builds are now non-incremental and assert both outputs exist. Adversarial review then proved a self-rehashed package could forge live PASS; the exact attack and semantic variants are now regression tests and fail closed.
- Verified: lint; strict typecheck; 56 unit; 21 integration; 21 eval; 2 Chrome E2E; production build; deterministic evidence generation; 247-file clean-copy replay; 247-file/228-text-file static security scan
- Independent review: no unresolved P0/P1 remained after moving the one-run reservation before body reads, enforcing streamed byte limits, and regenerating all hash-bound artifacts.
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, and `submission:check`, each for an explicit owner/external/incomplete condition
- Evidence hash: `99f8da5a9c28356d0b6eef4a92e0ae5f8460de14a9f35a80197a98f1c3f588b9`
- Commit: `eae20ed5d92358361c449764ade91c74d7f2d4ba`
- Next: checkpoint the verified changes, then implement remaining independent M3/M8 write and impact surfaces before requesting owner-only live/license/deployment actions

### 2026-07-14 15:47 +09:00 — M0 official preflight and real OPA gate verified

- Milestone: M0 PASS; M4 engine gate PASS while UI portion remains in progress
- Change: verified official challenge rules and Developer Tools track; confirmed cached Devpost package is not callable; installed exact Next/OpenAI/Codex/Zod/Playwright stack; added checksum-pinned OPA 1.18.2 installer/runner/evidence; refreshed submission, license, container, and security truth boundaries
- Verified: frozen offline install; production audit 0 vulnerabilities after PostCSS 8.5.19 override; lint; TypeScript; 49 unit; 17 integration including 41 OPA cases; 21 eval; build; 200-file clean-copy replay; 200-file/198-text-file security scan; D01–D03 replay
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails only `license:check`, `container:check`, `submission:check`, and `test:e2e`, each for an explicit incomplete/owner/external condition
- Evidence hash: `2dc9b83479eae24d6086dd76c46bd1d07b4ceb64d2e82b229b6b7fbd4692a111`
- Commit: `1d7261d0f41201e8501558d8b59368605d258db1`
- Next: review and commit this checkpoint, then implement the server-side GPT-5.6 adapter and five-screen Next.js workspace without claiming live model evidence until credentials exist

Append newest entries at the top. Keep entries compact and evidence-oriented.

### 2026-07-14 12:38 +09:00 — M3 persisted workspace service verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline server-service subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added a repository port and framework-independent service for complete current-workspace reads, immutable policy-text `DRAFT` versions, and atomic ambiguity resolution
- Verified: unit 49/49 and integration 15/15; new text preserves authoritative golden cases and prior source; repeated choices are idempotent; stale expected versions and contradictory default-review choices do not create versions; three service-driven decisions survive SQLite close/reopen
- Commands: `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/workspace/service.ts`, `tests/unit/policy-workspace-service.test.mjs`, updated `tests/integration/policy-persistence.integration.test.mjs`
- Commit: `85259ea1e70449c1307b382e3f2541fb7e8c2327`
- Risks: no HTTP route or Decision Queue UI exists; those require the approved pinned Next.js application stack
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit, then re-audit remaining offline P0 work

### 2026-07-14 12:14 +09:00 — M3 offline SQLite persistence foundation verified

- Milestone: M3 (offline persistence subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict golden-case parsing and a transactional SQLite repository for projects, immutable versions, validated IR, lifecycle state, and ambiguity decision records
- Verified: unit 46/46 and integration 15/15; four versions, three reproducible decisions, policy text, golden cases, and `COMPILED` state survive a close/reopen; stale parents, silent resolutions, unrelated decision edits, invalid clause/source links, and corrupted JSON fail closed
- Recovered failures: first Windows test cleanup attempted to delete an open SQLite file and was fixed by closing before recursive cleanup; a later full run found `submission:draft` removed its tracked checker report before security scanning, so draft generation now writes an accurate `NOT_RUN` report and the scanner reports missing tracked files instead of crashing
- Truth boundary: local Node 22 `node:sqlite` is experimental; production runtime/volume behavior and web/API integration remain unverified
- Commands: local `node:sqlite` probe; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `src/persistence/sqlite.ts`, `src/domain/case-validation.ts`, persistence unit/integration tests
- Commit: `9e293e00e06e71adcf2789e89b330af848150825`
- Next: run the complete offline gate, review and commit this checkpoint, then continue approved external integration work

### 2026-07-14 11:48 +09:00 — M10 offline submission foundation verified

- Milestone: M10 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added evidence-derived English submission/demo drafts, machine-readable readiness state, strict fail-closed submission validation, unit/eval coverage, and a Git-history scanner self-pattern exclusion
- Verified: 21 submission and 4 demo files generated with mandatory non-final markers; checker reports exactly 37 independent unmet requirements; unit 43/43, integration 14/14, eval 21/21, security 188/188 files and 186 text files with zero findings, clean-copy replay 188 files, build, and three-drift demo all pass
- Commands: `pnpm submission:draft`; `pnpm submission:check`; `pnpm security:check`; `pnpm verify`
- Artifacts: `artifacts/submission/`, `artifacts/demo/`, `artifacts/security/security-report.json`, `artifacts/security/clean-checkout-report.json`
- Commit: `130c3553abdd1ad668d8c367c0f819d242962029`
- Risks: M10 remains incomplete until current official rules, live proof, owner-selected license, UI screenshots, video, HTTPS URLs, form data, and confirmation exist
- Next: commit this offline checkpoint, then obtain one scoped network approval for current official documentation and pinned dependency/OPA work

### 2026-07-14 11:33 +09:00 — M9 offline security and reproducibility foundation committed

- Milestone: M9 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added architecture/threat/limitations/runbook/license-review docs, NOTICE, current+history secret/path/unsafe-process scan, fail-closed license/container checks, container prerequisites, and isolated clean-copy reproduction
- Verified: security scan PASS across 158 files, 156 text files, and full Git history with zero findings; clean copy PASS across frozen offline install, lint, typecheck, 41 unit, 14 integration, 19 eval, build, reset, drift replay, and evidence regeneration; no credential variables forwarded
- Expected failures: project LICENSE requires owner acceptance; container lacks verified OPA, Dockerfile, health route, and running daemon; browser and submission remain absent
- Recovered failures: history patch scanning falsely joined empty `.env.example` values and was replaced by commit-tree scanning; clean-copy eval self-reference was made explicit as `IN_PROGRESS` until the outer run writes PASS
- Full gate: `pnpm verify` fails exactly `license:check`, `container:check`, `test:e2e`, and `submission:check`
- Commit: `9602a6c38c5707de8e4aafc32a9e0ea636fa2416`

### 2026-07-14 11:06 +09:00 — M8 offline impact and evidence foundation committed

- Milestone: M8 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: made numeric case boundaries derive from PolicyIR; corrected stale golden/drift clause links; added immutable 14→30 version impact, traceability diagnostics, deterministic evidence generation, SHA-256 manifest validation, strict verification summary, and tamper/false-PASS tests
- Verified: unit 41/41; integration 14/14; eval 16/16; 8 case expectations change under 14→30; G02 blocks automatic verification; 4/4 clauses, 4/4 rules, 41/41 cases, and 6 code locations linked; 25 evidence files regenerate to hash `05e6f75a03fafa655f97c491983d3044e214f8a30c56fa31099762c095eee655`
- Recovered failure: first parallel integration run deleted the shared fixture build during evidence generation; classified as code concurrency; isolated evidence compilation under `.tmp/evidence-fixture-build`; retry passed 14/14
- Truth boundary: verification summary remains `FAIL`; OPA, live GPT-5.6, live Codex, post-repair drift, security, browser, container, and deployment are `NOT_RUN`
- Commit: `efff64154be5645fed1a15bf564bdb849a608cf6`

### 2026-07-14 10:42 +09:00 — M7 offline repair-worker foundation committed

- Milestone: M7 (offline contracts only; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added strict worker inputs/results, mode-tagged injected backend, fresh trusted-copy lifecycle, canonical hash guard, closed command IDs, sanitized child environment, time/output limits, bounded retry, independent review rules, three prompts, schema, and snapshot
- Verified: unit 37/37; integration 12/12; eval 14/14; real fresh-copy fixture test command passes; canonical baseline remains unchanged; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Safety evidence: traversal/absolute paths and unknown commands are rejected; `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CODEX_API_KEY` are absent from child environments; output secrets and personal home paths are redacted; high/critical review blocks proof
- Truth boundary: snapshot execution mode is `OFFLINE_TEST_DOUBLE` with `liveCodexClaim: false`; no SDK call, Codex patch, or live review is claimed
- Commit: `0c6fb85f392243a578eea0452b8de4ff50e58910`

### 2026-07-14 10:06 +09:00 — M6 offline differential runner committed

- Milestone: M6 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: preserved D01–D03 in the 41-case corpus; added typed differential records, per-case error isolation, deterministic defect clustering, strict schema, report CLI, integration/eval coverage, and before/after snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; integration 9/9; eval 11/11; baseline 25 matches, 16 drifts, 0 errors; fixed reference 41 matches, 0 drifts, 0 errors; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Diagnostic correction: the first run exposed five previously unclassified promotional approvals outside basic eligibility; these are now truthfully reported as `PROMOTION_ELIGIBILITY_BYPASS`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EXPECTATION_NOT_OPA`; no Codex repair claim or web drift UX exists
- Commit: `866bb205455945e0ee14afc8f776c1f5efe5b782`

### 2026-07-14 09:49 +09:00 — M5 offline case/conflict/mutation engines committed

- Milestone: M5 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added 38-case deterministic corpus, conflict/minimal-contrast analysis, 10 mutation operators, actual reference execution, strict schemas, and reviewable score snapshot
- Verified: unit 32/32; eval 9/9; 3 conflicts; 35 one-field contrasts; all rules reached; 44/47 mutants killed (93.62%); all 3 survivors listed; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, M5 report, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `66431fc9b8dabb93438fd8ab8d51336c0169eb87`
- Expected gap: execution mode is `REFERENCE_EVALUATOR_NOT_OPA`; Case Lab and OPA evidence are not implemented
- Next: include D01–D03 in the canonical corpus and build before/after fixture differential reports

### 2026-07-14 09:36 +09:00 — M4 deterministic Rego compiler committed

- Milestone: M4 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added pure Rego v1 generation, strict Rego input guard, exhaustive predicate helpers, priority exclusions, default fallback, compiler line mappings, snapshots, and compile CLI
- Verified: unit 25/25; 3,008-byte source and manifest are byte-stable; every predicate type covered; unresolved/invalid IR rejected; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, build, compile/manifest output, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `27a2b924d44bd900c28cb393e58e5413bb857445`
- Expected gap: no OPA binary is installed, so Rego compile and evaluation remain unverified
- Next: deterministic case/conflict/mutation engines using the clearly labeled reference evaluator

### 2026-07-14 09:26 +09:00 — M3 offline versioned ambiguity resolution committed

- Milestone: M3 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added immutable closed-patch application, versioned decision records, idempotent/revisit semantics, golden contradiction blocking, compile guard, and lifecycle transition table
- Verified: unit 20/20; all six patch operations covered; seeded decisions advance v1 to v4 without mutating the original; default-review conflicts with G02; full offline gate fails only browser/submission
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `506a8187bf5fd419122d8d5fdde54c7d77ab728f`
- Expected gap: SQLite persistence, server restart evidence, and Decision Queue UI remain for the pinned app stack
- Next: implement the pure deterministic Rego compiler and snapshots offline

### 2026-07-14 09:17 +09:00 — M2 offline PolicyIR and interpretation contracts committed

- Milestone: M2 (offline subset; milestone remains in progress)
- Change: added exhaustive IR/patch types, strict semantic validation, fixed refund input schema, deterministic clause segmentation, diagnostic evaluator, strict JSON Schemas, interpreter prompt, recorded fixture, and eight-case eval corpus
- Verified: unit 11/11; eval 7/7; integration 5/5; all nine golden/drift examples agree with the diagnostic reference; unknown fields, executable predicates, dangling clauses, duplicate priorities, patch mismatch, and unsupported input fields are rejected
- Commands: lint, typecheck, unit, eval, integration, demo replay, build, fail-closed full verification, manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e535209fb2f3f4bac00c0fe95bcfdd27c1296549`
- Expected gap: no claim of live GPT-5.6 work; recorded metadata is explicit; Zod/OpenAI dependencies and official API verification remain approval-gated
- Next: implement M3 patch/version/state logic offline

### 2026-07-14 08:59 +09:00 — M1 domain and deterministic seeded fixture passed

- Milestone: M1
- Change: added strict refund input validation, six golden cases, three drift witnesses, canonical buggy and evaluation-only fixed TypeScript fixtures, safe reset/copy hashing, fixture-local tests, and demo replay
- Verified: root unit 4/4; integration 5/5; fixture-local 4/4 in canonical and reset copies; typecheck, lint, eval, and build pass; `demo:run` reports exactly D01/D02/D03 drift; canonical baseline remains unchanged
- Commands: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; fixture-local `npm test`; `pnpm demo:reset`; `pnpm demo:run`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; `pnpm verify`; manifest/diff/secret checks
- Commit: `e509486d525c1f3a5825d39469298b70acb5025f`
- Expected failure: offline full verification still fails only browser and submission gates
- Risk: future Codex repair context must include only a fresh baseline copy and never the `expected-fixed` directory
- Next: M2 offline PolicyIR/schema/segmentation/prompt contracts; live interpretation remains network-approval gated

### 2026-07-14 08:45 +09:00 — Fail-closed M0 scaffold committed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: added a dependency-free pnpm workspace, strict TypeScript build, required root script surface, unit/integration/eval tests, README, and safe environment template
- Verified: offline install, lint, typecheck, unit, integration, M0 eval, build, manifest hashes, staged diff, and secret-pattern scan
- Commands: `pnpm install --offline`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`; `pnpm test:integration`; `pnpm eval`; `pnpm build`; fail-closed gate commands; `git diff --cached --check`
- Commit: `c175d1c9e667dc98f258e36de11522479bc49ec0`
- Expected failures: `pnpm verify` fails only browser/submission gates; `pnpm verify:live` fails credentials/live integration; dev/demo commands fail because their later milestones are absent
- Risks: TypeScript is currently global rather than project-pinned; OPA and browser dependencies are absent; Docker daemon is stopped; official challenge and OpenAI/Codex facts remain unverified without approved network scope
- Next: continue independent M1 domain/fixture work, then use one approved network scope for official documentation and pinned dependency installation

### 2026-07-14 08:23 +09:00 — Preflight document-contract cleanup completed

- Milestone: M0
- Change: resolved all five document-contract defects; added Git safety/line-ending files; initialized `main`
- Verified: required control files read; stale contradiction phrases absent; `PolicyPatch` closed union present; offline/live gates separated; mutation threshold strict; current-branch/network boundary aligned; manifest/fences/M0–M10/goal length pass; staged diff clean; no credential-shaped values found
- Commands: environment/version commands; targeted `rg`; PowerShell manifest validator; `git diff --cached --check`; credential-shaped value scan
- Artifacts: updated control documents, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `PACK_MANIFEST.md`
- Commit: `38f8060cdb87c410f12e91d26b2d689ab1e07582`
- Risks: OPA is not installed; no `package.json` exists, so product lint/test/build/verify commands are not yet runnable; official online facts remain unverified because this checkpoint performs no network access
- Next: begin the remaining M0 product scaffold; request scoped network approval only when an install or official-document check is ready to run

## Active blockers

A blocker is valid only when the task cannot continue safely without external input. Continue all independent work first.

| ID | Type | Exact blocker | Work already completed | One owner action | Resume condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-000 | None | No active blocker for the current offline checkpoint | All approved independent work continues | None | Continue the checkpoint |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner/status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deadline compression | Medium | High | Preserve P0 vertical slice; cut only P1 | Codex / open |
| Live model/API outage | Medium | Medium | Keep recorded verified evidence clearly labeled | Codex / open |
| Hosted worker restrictions | Medium | High | Keep host live construction disabled; implement a fixture-only external worker RPC with hard process limits and teardown receipts | Codex / open |
| Codex SDK/live adapter mismatch | Medium | High | Current package/docs are pinned; validate the real adapter with fresh SDK evidence | Codex / open |
| Live attestation key custody | Medium | High | Keep private key outside Git/logs/evidence; inject only trusted public keys into verification | Codex / open |
| Repeated evidence-download pressure | Low locally / Medium when public | Medium | Exact 4 MiB/16 MiB bounds and one active archive build exist; add short metadata-keyed caching or shared rate limiting before public deployment | Codex / M9 open |
| Docker daemon unavailable | High | Medium | Continue non-container gates; start Docker Desktop before the container gate | Owner/Codex / open |
| Offline validator/Zod duplication | Medium | Medium | Cross-check both contracts and generate JSON Schema from the pinned runtime schema after network approval | Codex / open |
| Demo recording/account blocker | Medium | Medium | Prepare script, captions, screenshots, and exact owner action | Codex / open |

## Decisions pending

Link to IDs in `DECISIONS.md`.

- Project license selection requires owner acceptance; see D-013 and `docs/license-review.md`.

## Next action

`Implement the authentication-enforcing transport and external supervisor/worker runtime without enabling host live execution; separately verify the immutable Node base-image digest within an explicitly approved registry scope.`

## Pause handoff

Fill before `/goal pause` or any handoff.

- Why paused: `not paused; the authenticated transport checkpoint and its verification ledger are committed`
- Exact current state: `real mTLS transport, bounded supervisor, and durable replay are verified offline; host live construction/commands remain disabled, while the OS worker/image, egress proxy, immutable verifier, live Codex, dynamic container, and deployment remain absent`
- Last successful command: `pnpm verify completed 105 unit assertions, 46 integration, 22 eval, 3 browser, 286-file clean-copy, 261-file plus Git-history security, static container, and production build checks`
- Current failing command: `pnpm verify retains only owner LICENSE and 30-item non-final submission failures; pnpm container:verify fails at the unset immutable Node digest; pnpm verify:live fails at missing OPENAI_API_KEY and CODEX_MODEL before the unimplemented worker path`
- Uncommitted files: `none after the verification-ledger commit`
- Safe resume command/action: `start the separately built non-privileged OS worker/proxy/immutable-verifier boundary from b7b3cf9`
- One owner action, if any: `none`

## Final completion record

Do not fill until the end.

- Engineering definition of done: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- `pnpm verify`: `FAIL_EXPECTED — all implemented gates pass; owner LICENSE and non-final submission only`
- `pnpm verify:live`: `FAIL — host credentials plus OS worker/fresh GPT/Codex evidence absent; mTLS transport/supervisor/replay exist offline`
- Production deployment: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Public repository: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Demo video: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Challenge submission: `NOT_VERIFIED`
- Final evidence hash: `4b046b707d238da3d5de04e86bcf3e7218af81d301f0f3186e041a5c0b4cdbf1` (`PARTIAL_OFFLINE/FAIL`, not final live proof)
- Final commit/tag: `UNSET`
- Final truthful state: `NOT_STARTED`
